# Dwellingly App

This serves as the Frontend Repo of the Full Stack Application for [JOIN Organization's](https://joinpdx.org/) Dwellingly site being created per the [FIGMA designs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YqboQogczYm1HkyRqEtVSzeQ61T9hWU2/view). This site will eventually aid in supporting both tenants and landlords with a more streamlined rental property process.
